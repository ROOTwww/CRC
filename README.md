# CRC
This is a remote car controller embedded system design repo from start to end.  
I am planning to do RC controlled car family which starts with CRC-01 and CRC-02.  
This repo will hold Hardware design and fabrication files, Firmware files, Design documents and related tests and examples. CRC-01 Designed mainly around STM32F072 MCU and RFM95W LoRa communication module.  
This parts are easy to access for me and I will make few more versions that does and does not includes these parts in the future.
So stay tuned!

##Purpose
I did designed RC controlled Rover and Drones, few years back at the college. And I want to continue that as a hobby and experiment with new LoRa techs on the side.  

##TODO
- [ ] CRC-01 Manufacturing
- [ ] CRC-01 Firmware
- [ ] CRC-01 Tests
- [ ] CRC-01 Controller Design
- [ ] CRC-02 Controller Design
- [ ] CRC-02 Car design
